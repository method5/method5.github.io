The level of effort to install and configure depends on how complex and standardized your infrastructure is.  If your databases are all on the same platform, with a standard naming convention, installation may be easy.

If you have lots of custom setups, unsupported platforms, and duplicate names, things will be trickier.  The good news is that one side-effect of installing Method5 is that it helps you to clean up your environment and become more standardized.
