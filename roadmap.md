Release History:
----------------

* **8.1.0, 2016 November**: Added CLUSTER_NAME and Target Groups.
* **8.0.0, 2016 October**: Initial public release.
* **0.0.1 to 7.6.0, 2014 to 2016**: Internal project.

Possible Future Changes:
------------------------

The plans get increasingly more speculative as the time increases.  If you would like to request a feature please [create an issue on the repository](https://github.com/method5/method5/issues) or email me at hjon@ventechsolutions.com.

* **v8.2.0, 2016 December**: Added job timeouts, performance improvements.
* **v9, 2017**: Run shell scripts.  I've been using an internal solution for this, but it needs to be re-designed to work in other environments.
* **v10, 2017**: Run as SYS and run as SQL\*Plus.  These aren't particularly useful but may be necessary to convince some old-school DBAs.
* **v11, 2017**: Offline shell script running with scheduler agents.  This optional feature would add a lot of complexity.  But it would allow Method5 to automate boring tasks like installations and patching.  This would make it a more direct competitor to products like Salt and Ansible.
* **v12, 2018**: Create a web interface.  Method5 is a SQL extension, part of a programming language.  A website doesn't make sense in a lot of ways.  But eventually this may be necessary to convince managers.
