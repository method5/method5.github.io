##Introduction

Method5 is an open source program that extends Oracle SQL to allow parallel remote execution.  I'll show you what that means and how you can use it.

##Simple Example

Take any regular SQL or PL/SQL statement:

[CODE]

This returns one result from one database.

Add a few keywords and now you can execute that statement on all your databases at one time:

[CODE]

##Advantages

This may not look like much at first but a lot of interesting things just happened.  Let's take a minute to explain the benefits of running this way.

[highlight titles as you read them]
1. Performance - Results from hundreds of databases start returning in seconds because of parallel and asynchronous processing.
2. Interface - The entire program lives inside that `M5` function.  [highlight function]  This code works just as well in SQL*Plus, Oracle SQL Developer, TOAD, or any other program.
3. Relational Data - The data is a regular table.  [highlight rows].  The program is purely relational and only lives in a database.  The results are easy to save, share, and join.  You can use all your existing tools to manipulate the results.  There are no agents, plugins, websites, or configuration files.
4. Easy Administration - Administration tasks are well-documented and are only performed by one person.  Other DBAs only need that one line of code to use the program.
5. Security - You can't see it but there are a lot of security features happening in the background.  In case you're worried, there are no public database links and no shared passwords.
6. Exceptions and Metadata - The results, metadata, and exceptions are stored in tables.  The results from the last run can be accessed in these three views:
 
[CODE] [run in separate window!  There's some weird IDE problem if you try to select from the view while it's being populated]
 
When you query hundreds of databases there will often be a problem.  But those problems are recorded and don't stop other processing.
 
 
## What Can I Do With It?
 
Those are the basic features.  Let's briefly look at some additional features, and more complex examples of problems you can solve with Method5.
 
 
## Run as Procedure
 
While it's neat to run a query that returns results, in practice you normally want to run statements asynchronously in a procedure.  The procedure `M5_PROC` will do exactly that.
 
For example, this code locks user accounts with a password older than 60 days:
 
[RUN CODE]
 
If you look at the DBMS_OUTPUT, it displays useful information about exactly what was run, and where.  [look at dbms_output]
 
 
##TARGET LIST
 
The second, optional parameter, lets you quickly and precisely specify targets.
 
Let's say you want to lock an account, but only on specific databases. 
 
You can use comma-separated lists that include databases, environments, hosts, business names, and pattern-matching characters:
 
[CODE]
 
You can also use a query that returns target names, or configure a variable to represent a query:

##TABLE NAME - Space Management
 
Method5 stores results temporarily in tables with a default name.  If you want the results to stick around you can provide a custom name with the parameter `P_TABLE_NAME`.
 
For example, you can compare database segment sizes and save the results in a specific table for later analysis.
 
[CODE]
 
##TABLE EXISTS ACTION - Space Management
 
You have several options if the table already exists.  You can set the parameter `P_TABLE_EXISTS_ACTION` to one of ERROR, APPEND, DELETE, or DROP.
 
In this example I'm using `APPEND` - it lets us gather data into the same table as the last step, perhaps because we want to store the data every day for space forecasting.
 
[CODE]
 
##ASYNCHRONOUS - Performance Tuning  (30 seconds)
 
Setting the parameter `P_ASYNCHRONOUS` to TRUE or FALSE lets you wait for all the results or let the processing continue in the background.
 
For example, let's say want to count active sessions to see which database has been the busiest in the past hour.  Setting `P_ASCYNCHRONOUS` to FALSE will make the procedure wait for all the results before it finishes.
 
[CODE]
 
##Summary 45 seconds
 
Method5 doesn't just make you faster.  It makes you so much faster that it can transform the way you work.

First, it will improve the way you solve operational problem.   For example, when an environment is missing an index, don't just add the index, check for the missing index in other environments:

[CODE]

We all encounter strange, unexpected problems, like bad performance caused by too many objects in the recycle bin.  It's a rare problem and may never happen again, but it only takes a few seconds to check all your databases:

[CODE]

Every time you find a problem, spend just one minute to think about ways to find it, fix it, and prevent it on all other databases.  A single query today can save you hours tomorrow.


But Method5 is not just for day-to-day work.  It takes care of the difficult task of querying and controlling a huge number of databases.  With that work done, you can focus on larger tasks.  You may not need to buy that expensive commercial database program anymore.  You can build your own custom systems for things like monitoring, account management, preventive maintenance, configuration management, security compliance, and more.
