Automate SQL with Method5 remote execution

Session Summary for Attendees
-----------------------------

Learn how to easily run SQL, PL/SQL, and shell scripts on a large number of databases and hosts with the open source program Method5.  Remote execution is not just faster, it's a process that lets you find, fix, and prevent many problems that you would never solve one-database-at-a-time.  It starts as simply as SELECT * FROM TABLE(M5(p_code => 'SELECT * FROM DUAL', p_targets => 'DEV')); and can grow to solve many complex tasks.


Detailed Abstract for Review
----------------------------
Method5 is an open source program that extends Oracle SQL to allow parallel remote execution. It lets database administrators easily run SQL statements, PL/SQL blocks, and shell scripts quickly and securely on hundreds of databases.  Querying and controlling multiple databases can be as simple as this: select * from table(m5(p_code => 'select * from dual', p_targets => 'dev'));

Most organizations only automate a few obvious, pre-defined tasks.  Unexpected operational challenges don't have a scalable solution.  DBAs tend to avoid certain problems because they don't have the time to logon to each database and run a command.

Current automation tools can't transform the way you solve operational problems.  Existing tools are slow, complex, or insecure.  None of them are relational.

The ideal solution is a new dynamic SQL syntax that lets you easily specify the "what", the "where", and the "how" for statements.

Method5 is a robust, open source implementation used for years on a large government contract, managing over 400 databases and a petabyte of data.

It has a simple function interface and a more powerful procedure interface.
 
The program is fast, simple, relational, easy to administer, and secure.

Parameters control what code is run, where it is run, and how it is run.

Method5 was built using templated dynamic PL/SQL, links, a lexer, scheduler and pipes, table-driven configuration, and Oracle Data Cartridge.

Installation is easy and agentless.  Administration is well-documented and performed by only one person.

Real-life examples and scripts - Account management for 125K schemas, global data dictionary for 40 million objects, massive schema comparisons across dozens of databases, forecasts for managing a petabyte of storage, and more.

Method5 is a great tool for securing databases and the tool itself has been carefully hardened.  Both the program and the users can be precisely controlled to limit the databases, features, and privileges allowed.

Method5 is so fast it can change the way you work: be proactive; treat all your databases as one logical database; and always spend the extra minute to find, fix, and prevent problems on all database.

Automate SQL and PL/SQL on many databases with Method5 remote execution

Abstract Description
--------------------
Learn how to easily run SQL and PL/SQL statements on a large number of databases with the open source program Method5.  Remote execution is not just faster, it's a process that lets you find, fix, and prevent many problems.  It starts as simply as SELECT * FROM TABLE(M5(p_code => 'SELECT * FROM DUAL', p_targets => 'DEV')); and can grow to solve complex tasks.

Presentation Summary

Querying and controlling multiple databases can be as simple as this: select * from table(m5('select * from dual', 'dev'));

Most organizations only automate a few obvious, pre-defined tasks.  Unexpected operational challenges don't have a scalable solution.  DBAs tend to avoid certain problems because they don't want to spend the time to manually run a command many times.

Current automation tools can't transform the way you solve operational problems.  Existing tools are slow, complex, or insecure.  None of them are relational.

The ideal solution is a new dynamic SQL syntax that lets you easily specify the "what", the "where", and the "how" for statements.

Title (80)
----------

Extend SQL and PL/SQL to run on multiple databases with Method5 remote execution

Learning objectives (I can't remember what they were called):
-------------------

The attendee will learn:
1. The need for a new type of dynamic SQL, where both the code and the targets can be programmatically controlled.
2. How to apply Oracle database and open source technologies to quickly run SQL statements on all databases.
3. Identify tasks that can benefit from rapid SQL automation.

Session Abstract
----------------
DBAs need to automate more than just common, pre-defined tasks. We need a more dynamic SQL and PL/SQL that lets us specify both what the statement is and where it runs. The open source program Method5 enables remote execution of SQL and PL/SQL. It starts with SELECT * FROM TABLE(M5('SELECT * FROM DUAL', 'DEV')); and has advanced features that can handle almost any task. PL/SQL, links, scheduler, pipes, and Data Cartridge create an agentless, fast, secure, and relational solution. Method5 is used to manage hundreds of databases and a petabyte of storage at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Faster administration lets us get in the habit of spending an extra minute to find, fix, and prevent problems on all our databases.
