Extend SQL and PL/SQL to run on multiple databases with Method5 remote execution

Learning objectives (I can't remember what they were called):
-------------------

The attendee will learn:
1. The need for a new type of dynamic SQL, where both the code and the targets can be programmatically controlled.
2. How to apply Oracle database and open source technologies to quickly run SQL statements on all databases.
3. Identify tasks that can benefit from rapid SQL automation.

Session Abstract
----------------
DBAs need to automate more than just common, pre-defined tasks. We need a more dynamic SQL and PL/SQL that lets us specify both what the statement is and where it runs. The open source program Method5 enables remote execution of SQL and PL/SQL. It starts with SELECT * FROM TABLE(M5('SELECT * FROM DUAL', 'DEV')); and has advanced features that can handle almost any task. PL/SQL, links, scheduler, pipes, and Data Cartridge create an agentless, fast, secure, and relational solution. Method5 is used to manage hundreds of databases and a petabyte of storage at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Faster administration lets us get in the habit of spending an extra minute to find, fix, and prevent problems on all our databases. 

Biographical Sketch:

He enjoys creating open source software on GitHub and is active on Stackoverflow where he is a top user in Oracle and PL/SQL.  He has a Master of Computer Science degree from North Carolina State University.


Abstract (limit 750 characters)
-------------------------------

Method5 is an open source program that extends Oracle SQL to allow parallel remote execution. It lets database administrators easily run SQL statements quickly and securely on hundreds of databases.  Querying and controlling multiple databases can be as simple as this: select * from table(m5('select * from dual', 'dev'));

Most organization only automate obvious, pre-defined tasks.  Unexpected operational challenges don't have a scalable solution.

Current automation tools can't transform the way you solve operational problems.  Existing tools are slow, complex, or insecure.  None of them are relational.

The ideal solution is a new dynamic SQL syntax that specifies the "what" and the "where" for statements.

Method5 is a robust, open source implementation used for years in a large production environment.

It has a simple function interface and a more powerful procedure interface.
 
The program is fast, simple, relational, easy to administer, and secure.

Parameters control what code is run, where it is run, and how it is run.

Method5 was built using templated dynamic PL/SQL, links, a lexer, scheduler and pipes, table-driven configuration, and Oracle Data Cartridge.

Installation is easy and agentless.  Administration is well-documented and performed by only one person.

Examples - Account maintenance, global data dictionary, schema comparisons, forecasts, and more.

More information is available at http://method5.github.io and the GitHub repository.

Method5 is so fast it can change the way you work: be proactive; treat all your databases as one logical database; and always spend the extra minute to find, fix, and prevent problems on all database.
